theory, including but not limited to:

* Homotopical and higher-categorical semantics of type theory
* Synthetic homotopy theory
* Applications of univalence and higher inductive types
* Cubical type theories and cubical models
* Formalization of mathematics and computer science in homotopy type theory / univalent foundations
* Higher dimensional category theory

### Submissions

Submissions open 3rd February, the **Deadline is 19th March 2023**. We expect to
notify accepted submissions by 24th March.

<!-- This conference is run on the "mathematics model" rather than the
"computer science model": full papers will not be submitted,
submissions will not be refereed, and submission is not a publication
(although a proceedings volume might be organized afterwards).  More
information, including registration, accomodation options, and travel,
will be available as the conference approaches on this web site. -->

Submissions will be handled via EasyChair. In order to submit your abstract, please follow these steps:
1. If you donâ€™t have it, download the latest EasyChair Latex class and related files from [here](https://easychair.org/publications/easychair.zip).
2. Download the [hott-2023-template.tex](../files/hott-2023-template.tex) file
   and save it in the same directory as the EasyChair Latex class file.
3. Write your abstract (maximum 2 pages) using the template and prepare a pdf file.
4. Submit the pdf file via the [EasyChair submission
page](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hott2023) (you'll have to create
an account if you don't have one yet).

Talks reporting on work in progress are welcome!

Please email [hott2023conference@gmail.com](mailto:hott2023conference@gmail.com) with any questions.

### Best Student Paper Award

A prize of $500 (and distinguished billing in the conference program)
will be awarded to the best paper submitted by a student (or recently
graduated student).

The program committee will select a paper based, either entirely or mainly, on
work carried out by a current or recently defended student.

To be eligible for this prize, you must include in your submission (or send
separately to
[hott2023conference@gmail.com](mailto:hott2023conference@gmail.com)) a link to a
preprint version of your paper (e.g. on arXiv or a private web space).
