To register, follow [this
link](https://starrez.housing.cmu.edu/StarRezPortalConference/go/Conferences/homotopy2023)
and click **Sign Up** at the bottom of the page.
The registration fee is **$100** until May 1, and **$125** after May 1 for late
registration. The final deadline for registration is May 14.

Students who want to apply for NSF funding (see below) should begin the
registration process, but not finish and pay. If approved, we will then pay
their registration cost directly. In case the fee is already paid at the time of
registration, it is still possible to apply for reimbursement.

### Financial support

registration, travel, and accommodation expenses. To apply please fill in [this

and additionally ask your supervisor to send a brief email supporting your
application to

Applications from underrepresented groups are especially encouraged. Recent
graduates are also welcome to apply.
